## `PEP0440` Styling Guide

Packaging for `PyPI` follows the standard PEP0440 styling guide and is implemented by the **`packaging.version.Version`** class. The other
popular versioning scheme is [`semver`](https://semver.org/), but each build has different parts/mapping.
The following table gives a mapping between these two versioning schemes:

<div align = "center">

| `PyPI` Version | `semver` Version |
| :---: | :---: |
| `epoch` | n/a |
| `major` | `major` |
| `minor` | `minor` |
| `micro` | `patch` |
| `pre` | `prerelease` |
| `dev` | `build` |
| `post` | n/a |

</div>

One can use the **`packaging`** version to convert between PyPI to semver and vice-versa. For more information, check

  * 🎉 - **Major Feature** : something big that was not available before.
  * ✨ - **Feature Enhancement** : a miscellaneous minor improvement of an existing feature.
  * 🛠️ - **Patch/Fix** : something that previously didn’t work as documented – or according to reasonable expectations – should now work.
  * ⚙️ - **Code Efficiency** : an existing feature now may not require as much computation or memory.
  * 💣 - **Code Refactoring** : a breakable change often associated with `major` version bump.

### PolySkills v1.0.0 | 2026-05-25

The world of AI is evolving fast, and agent workflows, skills are the new *norms* to build awesome projects. A skill is an additional
information that is passed to a LLM tool to do a specific task, however, it is often difficult to manage skills by maintaining a
single source that can be address across various projects, systems, etc. In addition, a skill can have version controlling and
updates - to address this [**`polyskills`**](https://github.com/PyUtility/polyskills) can be used.

```shell
$ pip install polyskills
$ polyskills "https://www.github.com/<owner>/<repository>" --get-skills
$ polyskills "https://www.github.com/<owner>/<repository>" --update <skill-name> --directory ".skills/"
```

The module is designed without any exotic dependency - the job: (I) fetch lists of skills defined under a remote version control
system with ``git tag skillName@vX.Y.Z` format, (II) add/update the skill in the required directory.
